PopH264.UnityPackage
=================

- This is a release-binaries repository of https://github.com/NewChromantics/PopH264 in the form of a Unity compatible package
- Binaries (`.dll`s, `.dylib`s etc) and c# interface[s] (`PopH264.cs`) all [should] come from automated releases of the PopH264 repository.
- Refer to there for source, details of API, release notes etc.
- This repository is mostly a convience wrapper for unity. (Everyone should be using packages!)
- Versions of this package are intended to be in-line with Poph264 versions. (We will see how long this lasts)
